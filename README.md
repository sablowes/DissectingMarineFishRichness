# DissectingMarineFishRichness

This repository contains code associated with an analysis of the Reef Life Survey (see [reeflifesurvey.com](https://reeflifesurvey.com/)).
We dissect species richness into component patterns of the total abundance of individuals, the relative abundance of species and their spatial aggregations at multiple scales to show that the latitudinal and longitudinal gradients of reef fish richness emerge from divergent scale-dependent component patterns.

**Scripts**:
  1. code to clean raw data and resample at multiple scales  
  2. code to create spatial weights matrices for fitting simultaneous autoregressive models (SAR)  
  3. fit SARs to total abundance  
  4. fit SARs to relative abundance  
  5. fit SARs to species richness  
  6. fit SARs to asymptotic species richness  
  7. plot results for total abundance, relative abundance and species richness  
  8. code to calculate ecoregion means for use in beta-diversity analyses  
  9. fit least squares and generalised least square models to beta-diversity  
  10. examine sensitivity of total abundance SARs to extent  
  11. examine sensitivity of relative abundance SARs to extent  
  12. examine sensitivity of species richness SARs to extent
